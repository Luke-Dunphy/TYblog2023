                            <p>Today was day 1 of the TY Red Hat work experience.It was a great day overall in my opinion,
                                the day started off with all 10 students going to the boardroom to find out what redhat is
                                 from Brendan we then got to see are timetable and what we had to do for the week from the 
                                 person who will be taking care of us for the week Cathal.We then met James who talked about
                                 redhat and what the company is and how the make money after that we played a game where 
                                you got a sheet taped onto your back and you had to guess the famous person on your back.
                                After that we got a tour of the building from the secratary and this place is massivve.
                                </p>
                            <p>When we finished the tour we then sat back down at our desks and Cathal put work up onto 
                                the board, the work consisted of downloading three softwares Vscode,Python and Git we
                                then had to signup to Github,Trello and Slack once we had signed up to slack we then 
                                had to send are username onto Cathal all that work led us up to lunch.
                            </p>After lunch we had a workshop for two hours where we talked about how to use Git and we 
                                also talked about our blogs aswell we also used a software called terminal and getting to 
                                know how to use it fully and the codes to put in the software for shortcuts and to know 
                                where we actually are.

                            <p>Today was day 2 of Redhat we started at 9:30 today instead of yesteday satrting at 10:00.
                                The day started off by completing the previous days tasks or working on our blog which 
                                lasted until 10:30, we then got talk from Sarah Finn on Agile in this meeting we talked
                                about what is agile,the benefits that you can experience,the history of agile,agile at 
                                work,the agile mindset,agile success factors and the slogan that we use Try Rinse Repeat.
 
                                After the talk or meeting we got given a hour to work on the previous tasks that we hadnt
                                finished or work on our blogs which ended up taking us up to lunch.

                                After lunch we got too have a two hour workshop with Dominik wich I really enjoyed personally. 
                                I felt this workshop really helped understand the microbit more and helped me to learn more about 
                                coding the microbit.Ive been learning microbit in school for a few weeks but never really understood 
                                it but after this workshop with Dominik I feel i understand the microbit more now.After the workshop 
                                we only had an hour till we got to go home so me and the other TY students just worked on our blogs 
                                and I also had a chat with Cathal about what I though of the workshop and what did I think of the 
                                first few days.

                                Today was day 3 of Redhat, again we started at 9:30 the same as yesterday.Today was a 
                                different day it was more of a relaxed day as the first two days were heavy in work. 
                                We started the day off by completing the previous days tasks or working on our blogs
                                for the first hour of the day after that we did some team building workshop where we 
                                got to build lego for a hour which was really good after that we got a talk from 
                                Rachel Lawton who talked about a day in the life of a software engineer and her back 
                                story and on how she didnt take the traditional root into getting hired by Redhat.
                                After the talk we got some free time where we could continue to work on our blog or 
                                go for an early lunch whish was pretty good,I wont lie I took the early lunch instead.
                            
                            
                                
                            
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               After lunch we had a talk with Rachels little brother Daniel Lawton which was about 
                               student life,this talk was very funny in all ways as he was talking abouut drinking,
                               the college life,SETU and not knowing what he actually wanted to do for college.He 
                               went into great detail on the computing course and on why he thinks SETU is better 
                               than any other colleges and to be fair he made some great points and while he was 
                               doing that he probably made a fool out of his sister Rachel which was pretty funny,
                               after the talk we were supposed to do another teamwork challenge and the challenge 
                               was called the Bridge challenge but Cathal decided not to do the work shop but to 
                               let us work on our blogs or let us work on the previous team building challenge 
                               which was the lego challenge in all it was a very funny and a very good day.
